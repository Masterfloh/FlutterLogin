# Contributing

Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing : 

1. Is your Contribution fit for Disitribution? Is there Data leaking anywhere or is there perhaps a Security Issue? 
2. Are the steps one can take to make the feature more redundant? Redundancy is key when building Web apps! 
3. Is your Contribution relevant? Does it increase the overall functionality of the app?
