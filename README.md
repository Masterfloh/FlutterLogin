A Flutter login design project without a backend because im lazy. This login page is good for redirecting customers or users who already have an account and thus do not need to sign up

## **Landing page**
This is the page users land on once they have logged in using their Email, Google or Facebook. It is just a blank page with Text on it. This page is meant for either further verifiaction of the customer (e.g. captchas) or the start of the actual app.

## Important Side note

The Login page was created in Android Studio using a Google Pixel 3a and Google Pixel 6 Pro, so keep in mind that the dimensions used may not be suitable for other Phones like an Iphone X, Tablets, or any other machine capable of running Web applications.
